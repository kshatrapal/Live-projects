# 🌐 Real-World React Projects Showcase

This repository serves as a portfolio to showcase several real-world web applications built using **React.js**, **Redux**, and modern frontend tools.

Each project demonstrates my hands-on experience in building scalable and responsive UIs, integrating REST APIs, managing global state with Redux, and applying performance optimizations.

Below you'll find live deployed versions of these projects across domains like real estate, accounting, e-commerce, fitness, and finance.
